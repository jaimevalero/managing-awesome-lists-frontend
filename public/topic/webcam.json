Using provided libraries users are able to read camera images and detect motion. Main project consist of several sub projects - the root one, which contains required classes, build-in webcam driver compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS, which can stream images as fast as your camera can serve them (up to 50 FPS). Main project can be used standalone, but user is able to replace build-in driver with different one - such as OpenIMAJ, GStreamer, V4L4j, JMF, LTI-CIVIL, FMJ, etc.","topics":["webcam","java","webcam-capture"],"created_at":"2012-05-25T20:26:28Z","pushed_at":"2025-11-08T18:52:08Z","stargazers_count":2339,"language":"Shell"},{"full_name":"mainsail-crew/MainsailOS","description":"This Raspberry Pi distribution for managing Klipper 3D printers with Mainsail provides all you need.","topics":["klipper","mainsail","mainsail-os","raspberry-pi","3d-printing","distribution","image","moonraker","sonar","webcam"],"created_at":"2020-08-02T20:13:45Z","pushed_at":"2025-10-30T11:24:31Z","stargazers_count":705,"language":"Shell"}],"frecuent_topics":{"webcam":3,"pytorch":1,"deep-learning":1,"ssd":1,"object-detection":1}}
