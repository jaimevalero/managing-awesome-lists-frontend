It's a PCAP-based tool that allows you to specify an extended regular or hexadecimal expression to match against data payloads of packets. It understands many kinds of protocols, including IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw, across a wide variety of interface types, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.","topics":["sniffer","grepping"],"created_at":"2009-12-30T08:14:15Z","pushed_at":"2025-11-17T22:29:02Z","stargazers_count":983,"language":"Shell"},{"full_name":"alexcfv/go-pcaplite","description":"lite lib for parse network packets for golang (wrap for google/gopacket)","topics":["bytes","golang","golang-library","ip","network","network-analysis","protocol","sniffer","tcp","udp"],"created_at":"2025-08-28T19:12:39Z","pushed_at":"2025-10-14T16:48:25Z","stargazers_count":7,"language":"Go"}],"frecuent_topics":{"sniffer":4,"pcap":2,"network":2,"pcapng":1,"packet-capture":1}}
